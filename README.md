# place-albania
try to take over the canvas!

This script doesn't draw for you, it only shows guides where to draw what color. New version 1.0 - now you won't need to update your script, latest guide will be on your screen after you refesh reddit page :D

To setup the script follow steps bellow:

Download TamperMonkey extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

Then click on the extension the top right of Chrome (please use chrome, might not work on other browsers)

Copy the script from the data called "place-albania.js"

Now open the Tapermonkey extension and go on "create new userscript"

Now replace the code inside with the code you just copied.

Now go on File and Save "CTRL + S"

Now go on reddit, after refreshing reddit page you should see where you have to draw.

Make sure to have the Plugin activated.
