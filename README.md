try to take over the canvas!

This script doesn't draw for you, it only shows guides where to draw what color. New version 1.0 - now you won't need to update your script, latest guide will be on your screen after you refesh reddit page :D

To setup the script follow steps bellow:

1. Download TamperMonkey extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

Then click on the extension the top right of Chrome (please use chrome, might not work on other browsers)

2. Now download the file https://github.com/Celidons/place-albania/blob/main/place-albania.user.js
and press on 
"raw"

now you download the file and make sure that you got TamperMonkey activated.

3. Go on reddit, after refreshing the reddit page you should see where you have to draw.

It should look something like this:
