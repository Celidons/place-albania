# place-albania
try to take over the canvas!

This script doesn't draw for you, it only shows guides where to draw what color. New version 1.0 - now you won't need to update your script, latest guide will be on your screen after you refesh reddit page.

To setup the script follow steps bellow:

1. Download TamperMonkey extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

2. Go to this file https://github.com/Celidons/place-albania/blob/main/place-albania.user.js
and press on "raw", now u download the script with Tampermonkey

3. Check if Tampermonkey is active, now you can visit r/place and it should show you where to paint in which colour.
