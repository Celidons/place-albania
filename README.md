try to take over the canvas!

This script doesn't draw for you, it only shows guides where to draw what color. New version 1.0 - now you won't need to update your script, latest guide will be on your screen after you refesh reddit page :D

To setup the script follow steps bellow:

Download TamperMonkey extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

Then click on the extension the top right of Chrome (please use chrome, might not work on other browsers)

Now download the file chrome-extension://dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/ask.html?aid=f6b70f1b-03fc-4df6-badf-4ce7798b03db

Now go on reddit, after refreshing reddit page you should see where you have to draw.

It should look something like this:
